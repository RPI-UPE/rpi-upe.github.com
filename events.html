          <h2>Events</h2>
          <p>UPE sponsors a number of events on campus that we believe are of interest to Rensselaer students. This list of events will be updated as we adjust our schedule throughout the semester.<br /><br />
          For information on our I/O lecture series, see <a href="io.html">our dedicated page</a>.<br /><br />
          Weekly meetings are held on Wednesdays from 4-5pm in Amos Eaton Room 117 and are open to everyone.</p>

<h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
<h4>Apr 9: Vim vs Emacs Showdown</h4>
<p>

Ever argued which is better, vim or emacs? Well next week, we'll put those arguments to the ultimate test.

Come watch Prof. Cutler and Prof. Goldschmidt duke it out in the ultimate text editor vs text editor competition. This will be a 5 part, keyboard on keyboard fight to the arthritis battle royal. No mistakes, no going back, and no use of the mouse.

Think you already know who will win? Well you can put your money where your mouth is. We will be holding a $1 Bet/Raffle to support girls who code charity.

So come cheer on your favorite text editor (Or favorite professor).
