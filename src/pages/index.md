# Upsilon Pi Epsilon

Welcome to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute chapter of Upsilon Pi Epsilon, the only international honors society for the computing and information disciplines.
Our membership consists of outstanding undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of Computer Science, Information Technology, and Computer Engineering.
Members are chosen not only for their scholastic achievement in a computing field, but also for distinguishing themselves as true professionals by meeting the standards of the society.
Members also provide a number of services to the Rensselaer community through tutoring services and remediation sessions.
