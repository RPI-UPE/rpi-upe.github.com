Considering UPE is comprised of only juniors, seniors, and graduate students, the membership committee is vital to the longevity of the chapter.
The committee is charged with finding new and effective ways of attracting potential members.
Once they have found interested candidates, it is also their responsibility to perform an initial review and summary of the candidate's strengths and weaknesses.
It will also have to collect all documents needed for application to the Rensselaer chapter of UPE.
Transient committees may be created to hold events to raise interest among new potential members.
The membership committee is the heart of the chapter, keeping the chapter's attendance high to keep the strength of the chapter high.
