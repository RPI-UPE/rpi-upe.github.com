The events committee is responsible for organizing and planning all events and activities for the Rensselaer chapter.
This includes events such as I/Os, programming competitions, and any UPE-specific activities.
At times, transient committees will be created for a short time by the planning committee to take care of one event and then dissolve.
These subcommittees must ensure adequate opportunities exist for all active and candidate members to demonstrate the minimum level of "required enthusiasm".
It is important for them to originate novel programs to add value to ongoing active membership.
The events committee acts as the legs of the chapter, keeping it moving and keeping it interesting.
