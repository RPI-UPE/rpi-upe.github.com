The finance committee is in charge of maintaining a budget, fundraising, collecting dues, and requesting funding from the Computer Science department and various other organizations.
If UPE plans to hold large, memorable, and useful events, it is important for the finance committee to budget and raise a sufficient amount of funds.
The finance committee will be the lungs of the chapter, breathing air into ideas and making anything possible.
